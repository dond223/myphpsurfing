# test48
This is my first attempt at adding a repository from the command line.

I am new to PHP. It is my first programming language. I have been using HTML5 and CSS3 for about 4 years on and off with 2 years as a Magento and WebPress
designer / developer. 

I hacked a lot of my way through the development of Magento 1.9 and just went along with the templates in WebPress.
However I want to understand the "under the hood of MVC so here I am learning PHP."

So far I love PHP and these are my beginning attempts to understand how to create with code.

If you have any suggestions of good places to learn drop me a message me. 
Thank you for visiting my repository .
